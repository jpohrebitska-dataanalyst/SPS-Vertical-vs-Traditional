# Executive Summary  
This project explores the efficiency of a **10 kW solar power station near Kyiv**, comparing vertical (90Â°), classic (45Â°), and dynamic tilt angles.  
Key findings show that vertical panels are nearly **ideal in winter** (Novemberâ€“February), while 45Â° panels provide **stable annual output**.  
For Ukraine, the best compromise is **45â€“50Â° fixed tilt**, while **seasonal adjustment (75Â°/25Â°)** or **dynamic systems** deliver maximum efficiency but at higher cost and complexity.

## Conclusions  
This project analyzes the efficiency of a **Solar Power Station 10 kW**, located near Kyiv, oriented to the south and installed vertically (90Â°).  
In Ukraine, the most common installation angle is around 45Â° (roof- or ground-mounted panels).

## 1. Theoretical Efficiency of a Vertical Panel  
- Based on **pvlib** calculations, a vertical panel in Kyiv:  
- Shows **the lowest efficiency** during summer, unlike a classic 45Â° panel.  
- Has **the highest efficiency** in winter: **Novemberâ€“February**.

## 2. Comparison with Actual Data  
- Real data from my station (Marchâ€“September 2025) aligns with the theoretical curve.  
- Deviations are explained by sunnier or cloudier days.  
- The strongest production is seen in **Marchâ€“April** and **Augustâ€“September**.  
- As expected, the peak output will occur in **Novemberâ€“February**, exactly when energy is most needed for heating.

## 3. Optimal Tilt Angle for Kyiv  
- Calculations show the **average annual optimal tilt â‰ˆ 49.5Â°**.  
- Monthly optimal angles:  
  - November â€” 82Â°, December â€” 90Â°, January â€” 87Â°, February â€” 71Â°,  
  - March â€” 53Â°, April â€” 34Â°, May â€” 20Â°, June â€” 8Â°,  
  - July â€” 11Â°, August â€” 28Â°, September â€” 46Â°, October â€” 64Â°.  
- Conclusion: **in winter, a vertical panel (90Â°) is nearly ideal**.

## 4. Comparison of Three Scenarios  
- Vertical (90Â°)  
- Classic (45Â°)  
- Dynamic (daily angle adjustment)  

Vertical panel shows:  
- **Absolute advantage** in January, February, November, December.  
- **Minimal losses** in October and March (<20%).  
- **Largest losses** in Aprilâ€“September (27â€“62%).

## 5. Efficiency Ranges  
- Dynamic: **31.7% â€“ 36.5%**  
- Classic (45Â°): **27% â€“ 31.8%**  
- Vertical (90Â°): **11.5% â€“ 36.5%**  

> **Efficiency** = cos(AOI), where AOI (Angle of Incidence) is the angle between the sunâ€™s rays and the panel surface.

## 6. Effect of Tilt in Other Regions of Ukraine  
- Optimal tilt for most Ukrainian cities: **45â€“50Â°**.  
- Losses for a vertical panel compared to classic: **19â€“23%**.  
- Losses compared to dynamic: **28â€“33%**.  

---  
## 7. Interactive Map of Ukraine  
- Using Python and **folium**, I created a map: clicking on a city shows the optimal tilt and efficiency losses.

## 8. Global Map (SunCalc.js)  
- Using **Gemini + SunCalc.js**, I built a global map of optimal tilt angles.  
- Results are close to pvlib but simpler to compute.  

Examples:  
- Oslo â€” vertical panel losses are ~10% compared to classic; vertical panels are a good option for heating during winter.  
- Northern Canada â€” losses are nearly zero; optimal tilt is above 60Â°.  
- Colombia â€” optimal tilt ~12Â°; vertical panel losses ~80% (making vertical panels unsuitable for such regions).

## 9. Key Insights for Ukraine  
- **45Â° (classic tilt)** â€” a compromise: not perfect for any month, but provides stable annual generation.  
- **90Â° (vertical panels)** â€” best for winter, easy to maintain, space-saving, maximize output in cold months.  
- **83Â°** â€” a compromise to boost winter generation, though harder to install.  
- **Seasonal tilt adjustment** (ideal option):  
  - Octoberâ€“March: 75Â°  
  - Aprilâ€“September: 25Â°  
- **Dynamic systems** (daily adjustment) â€” most efficient, but expensive and complex.

## 10. Practical Takeaways for Ukraine  
- If **annual generation** is the priority â†’ fixed tilt **45â€“50Â°**.  
- If **winter generation** is critical â†’ **90Â°** or **75Â°**.  
- Ideal setup â†’ **seasonal tilt adjustment**.
