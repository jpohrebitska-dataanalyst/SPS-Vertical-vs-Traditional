# Global Map (SunCalc.js)  
- Using **Gemini + SunCalc.js**, I built a global map of optimal tilt angles.  
- Results are close to pvlib but simpler to compute.  

Examples:  
- Oslo â€” vertical panel losses are ~10% compared to classic; vertical panels are a good option for heating during winter.  
- Northern Canada â€” losses are nearly zero; optimal tilt is above 60Â°.  
- Colombia â€” optimal tilt ~12Â°; vertical panel losses ~80% (making vertical panels unsuitable for such regions).
