## Solar Tilt Ukraine Map (Folium)

Using **Python + Folium**, I built an interactive map of optimal tilt angles across Ukraine.  
The map is based on **pvlib solar position calculations** and shows the difference in performance between vertical (90Â°) and traditional tilt panels.

### Examples:
- **Kyiv** â€” vertical panel losses are ~19.4% vs. 45Â° fixed tilt; however, vertical panels perform better in **Novemberâ€“February**.  
- **Lviv** â€” vertical panel losses are ~20.5% vs. 45Â° fixed tilt; however, vertical panels perform better in **Novemberâ€“February**.  
- **Odesa** â€” vertical panel losses are ~24.7% vs. 45Â° fixed tilt; however, vertical panels perform better in **Novemberâ€“February**.
